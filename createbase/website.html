                                        CreateBase was a startup delivering an online educational platform enabling students to create authentic solutions to real-world problems using 3D simulations and digital robotics.

                                    The platform provided teaching material for students to learn STEAM subjects and the basics of coding.

                                <p>The new website set out to improve the experience, demonstrate the product's value to target users, establish the company's branding and increase sign-ups to the platform.</p>

                                <p>I collaborated with the marketing coordinator (Weiwei) and product owner (Brydon) for early ideation and content management and the backend engineer (Carl) for implementation and testing.</p>

                                <p>The previous website version suffered many problems as the business pivoted in its search for product-market fit.</p>

                                <p>We wanted to improve the sign-up rate for the CreateBase platform to get more teachers and students to experience our offerings and give us meaningful feedback. Through interviews with teachers, we discovered concerns about their "confidence" in signing up for a brand new platform not already integrated into the education system.</p>
                                <p>We questioned:</p>
                                <img class="zoom" src="/images/cb/problem.jpg" alt="problem">
                            </div>

                                <p>The problem was broken down into three smaller goals, each attempting to improve teachers' confidence to sign-up and try our platform.</p>
                                <div class="sub-text-container">
                                    <h4 class="sub-title">Improve product understanding</h4>
                                    <p>Design the new website using specific user journeys that cater to a range of teachers. Due to technology teachers' different priorities, we needed to consider that they all have different teaching styles, curriculums, school-specific content structures, and other factors. We wanted our product to resonate with the needs of teachers. The flow of information and user journeys were essential.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="sub-text-container">
                                    <h4 class="sub-title">Relevant "at a glance" content</h4>
                                    <p>Conveying the core product offerings clearly whilst showcasing important features efficiently to teachers is crucial to giving them more confidence in registering and trying out the platform. Teachers told us about the importance of their spare time, especially when looking for new resources.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="sub-text-container">
                                    <h4 class="sub-title">Consistency is key</h4>
                                    <p>Utilise the power of familiarity by making the website and platform components and web stack consistent. This reduced the new platform's learning curve and made it easier for users to start using the product immediately. Alongside this ease of use, usage speed and retention from having a smooth experience can improve for different users.</p>
                                </div>

                                <h4 class="title">Our customers</h4>
                                <p>Teachers from primary, intermediate and college schools were interviewed to understand their first-hand experiences with online educational tools and using them within their classes.</p>
                                <p>From interviews and live and online demos, we could better understand the perspectives of many different types of teachers. Using the insights gained and our observations, we could then confidently create three personas that we could refer to throughout our process of designing the new website.</p>

                                <p>Provided are some of many versions of the early website flows, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes created in Figma. The initial website flows were created using different approaches based on the personas. </p>
                                <p>
                                    At this stage, my main goal is to diverge first, then converge. As the flow of the content was one of the priorities, this was combined and iterated multiple times before the low-fidelity mockups began.

                                <p>To test our prototypes and validate our design decisions, we experimented with teachers remotely during lockdowns, ensuring the safety of all parties.</p>
                                <p>Several semi-unstructured observational tests were conducted, primarily observing how users browsed the home page Figma prototype whilst they spoke aloud about what they were thinking throughout the process.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Essential insights and behaviours were documented and shared with the team. This test was mainly for qualitative feedback and provided valuable insights into the home page's usability.

                                <p>I was solely responsible for the coding implementation of the website after the design process. The website was coded using ReactJS, TypeScript, NextJS, SASS, Express, HTML, CSS, and Git.</p>

                                <h4 class="title">Outcomes</h4>
                                <p>After the implementation of the website, the total registered users had a weekly growth rate of 120% on the platform. This led to 200+ active users spread throughout schools in NZ, AUS and the UK in the first 2 months of release.</p>

                                    <h4 class="sub-title">Proving the efficacy of user testing in a fast-moving environment</h4>
                                    <p>When working in a fast-paced startup environment, the constant want to develop and find results can lead to essential processes like user testing being underestimated in its effectiveness for the business. I met with the team to discuss the value of saving potential development time and reducing technical debt made possible by testing and how it should have been a higher priority.</p>
                                    <p>After this process, there was praise for how effective the testing results were. Team members stated that seeing the interactions with our products from teachers and the results provided great insights that confirmed or challenged their previous assumptions about our users. Insights like these helped ensure that we provided teachers with the best experience for their different needs.</p>

                                    <h4 class="sub-title">Taking a step back</h4>
                                    <p>I ensured that we kept the goals in mind at every point of the design process and avoided getting too lost on the macro and forgetting to look at the big picture. Meeting with members from different teams helped re-align and provide helpful feedback on improvements to the website and the surrounding campaign.</p>
